4. **Create a New Branch**
   - It’s a good practice to create a new branch for your changes. This helps keep your work organized and separate from the main codebase. Run:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```
   - Replace `<branch-name>` with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `fix-typo`, `add-new-feature`, etc.).

6. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**
   - After making the necessary changes, stage them with:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Then, commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
     ```

7. **Push Changes to Your Forked Repository**
   - Push the changes you’ve made to your forked repository using the command:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

8. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
   - After pushing your changes, navigate to your fork on GitHub.
   - Click the **Compare & pull request** button to open a PR. Ensure that your branch is being compared to the main repository’s `main` (or `master`) branch.
   - Add a meaningful description to explain your changes, and submit your pull request.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality.
- If your pull request addresses an open issue, link to the issue in your PR description.
- Please be patient after submitting your PR, as it might take some time to review.

**Happy Hacking! :)**
