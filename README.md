4. **Create a New Branch**
   - It's a best practice to create a new branch for your changes to keep your work organized and independent from the `main` branch. To create a new branch, run:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```
   - Replace `<branch-name>` with a descriptive name, such as `fix-typo`, `add-feature`, or `update-docs`.

6. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage all your changes with:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
     ```

7. **Push Changes to Your Fork**
   - Push the changes to your forked repository using:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

8. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - After pushing your changes, go to your fork on GitHub.
   - Click the **Compare & pull request** button. Ensure that your branch is being compared to the main repository’s `main` (or `master`) branch.
   - Provide a meaningful description explaining the purpose of your PR, and click **Create Pull Request**.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your changes do not break any existing functionality.
- If your pull request addresses an existing issue, mention it in your PR description by linking the issue (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Please be patient while your PR is reviewed. It might take some time to get feedback or approval.
